Default Image Placeholders

For production use, you should place the following image files in this directory:

1. default-poster.jpg - A placeholder image for movie/TV show posters (recommended size: 500x750 pixels)
2. default-profile.jpg - A placeholder image for person profiles (recommended size: 185x278 pixels)

You can create these images yourself or download placeholder images from various stock photo websites.

For example, you could use:
- A simple gradient with text "No Poster Available"
- A silhouette of a film reel or clapperboard
- A generic avatar silhouette for the profile image

These images will be displayed when the TMDb API doesn't provide poster or profile images for certain movies, TV shows, or people.
